Student's t distribution + Hypothesis testing + Tests iin 1-sample, paired-smaple and 2-sample means + Relationship Between Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals
### Student's t distribution
- A family of distribution identified by "Student" (William Sealy Gosset.
- t family members are identified by their degrees of freedom, *df*.
- t distribution are similar to z distribution but with broader tails.
- As df increases  -> t tails get tkinner -> t become more like Z~N(0,1)
  > The t ditribution becomes more like a standard distribution as the *df* increases.
  > - A t distribution with infinite *df* is a standard normal distribution.
  > - A t distribution with 60 or more *df* is indistinguished from a standard normal distribution.

### Degrees of freedom
The number of independent (i.e. free to vary) pieces of information that go into the estimate of a parameter is called the degrees of freedom (*df*).

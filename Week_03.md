Probability concepts + Random variable + Binomial distribution
### Probability concepts
- **Random variable**: a numerical quantity that takes on different values depending on chance
  > - *Discrete*: a countable set of possible outcomes
  > - *Continuous*: an unbroken continuum of possible outcomes
- **Event**: an outcome r a set of outcomes
- **Probability**: the proportion of times an event is expected to occur in the population

<ins>Properties of Probabilities<ins/>

(Let A be an event...)
- 0 <= *Pr(A)* <= 1
- Sum of *Pr* = 1
- *Pr(Ā)* = 1 – *Pr(A)* (Ā: the complement of A, {not A})
- If *A* and *B* are disjoint outcomes, the *Pr*(A or B) = *Pr*(A) + *Pr*(B). *Pr*(A and B) = 0

<ins>Discrete random variable<ins/>

*Probabilty mass function(pmf)*: a mathematical relation that assigns probablities to all possible outcomes for discrete random variable.
> - Definitional formula for mean or expectation: ***μ***=∑r⋅*Pr*⁡(X=r)
> - Definitional formula for variance: ***σ^2***=∑(r-μ)^2⋅*Pr*⁡(X=r)
> - Cumulative probability: probability that X is of value r or less, i.e., *Pr*(x<=r)

**Tabular descriptive statistics on categorical variables:**
> •	Categories can be arranged in any order.
> 
> •	Mathematical/arithmetic operations are not meaningful.
> 
> •	Allowable calculations are count (*frequency*) and *proportions* (%s) of categories.


- Single categorical variable can be summarized using:
  > - Frequency table
  > - Relative frequency table

- Two categorical variables can be summarized using:
  > - Contingency table (cross-tabulation)
  > > presents the count (frequency) and proportions of 2 categorical variables in a row X column format.

**Tabular descriptive statistics on continuous variables:**

Mathematical/arithmetic operations are not meaningful.

- Single continuous variable can be summarized using:

> Summary descriptive statistics

- **Center Location** (Center of the variable)
  - Mean          - Average value
  - Median(Q2)    - Middle value (50th percentile)
  - Mode          - Most frequent value
> The mean is the traditional measure of central location.  The median is more resistant to skews and outliers than the mean; it is more robust.  The mode is useful only in large data sets with repeating values.


- **Variability** (Spread or Dispersion of the variable)
  - Minimum       - Min value
  - Q1            - First quartile (25th percentile)
  - Q3            - Third quartile (75th percentile)
  - Maximum       - Max value
  - Range         - Max-Min
  - Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)         - Q3-Q1
  - Variance      - A collective measure of the distances between the individual values and the mean
  - Standard Deviation   - Square-root of the variance
    > The standard deviation is the most common descriptive measure of variability and is based on deviations around the mean.  Always report a measure of central location, a measure of spread, and the sample size.
  
   * Report (mean ± standard deviation) for symmetrical mound-shaped distributions.
   * Report (min., Q1, median, Q3, max.) or (median and IQR) for odd shaped distributions.

Distribution:
1. mean = median >>> *symmetrical*
2. mean > median >>> *positive skew*
3. mean < median >>> *negative skew*

- Two continuous variable can be summarized using:
  - Correlation co-efficient
    - he correlation co-efficient (ρ or r) describes the direction and <ins>strength</ins> of <ins>linear relationship</ins> between the 2 continuous variables.
    - 1 <= r <= 1
    - "-ve" value: a decreasing relationship; strong when close to -1.
    - value close to 0 indicates independence between 2 variables.
    - "+ve" value: a increasing relationship; strong when close to 1.
    - *Pearson correlation coefficient*: parametric, value-based
    - *Spearman correlation coeffient*: nonparametric, rank-based

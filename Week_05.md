Test on 1-sample and 2-sample proportions + Confidence Intervals + Chi-square test for independence
### 1-sample proportion(*p*)
- A family of distribution identified by "Student" (William Sealy Gosset.
- t family members are identified by their degrees of freedom, *df*.
- t distribution are similar to z distribution but with broader tails.
- As df increases  -> t tails get tkinner -> t become more like Z~N(0,1)
  > The t ditribution becomes more like a standard distribution as the *df* increases.
  > - A t distribution with infinite *df* is a standard normal distribution.
  > - A t distribution with 60 or more *df* is indist
